Parallel Computing with Javascript
---

This branch experiments with a completly rewritten API and internal structure for parallel.js.

For details on the implementation look at this [issue](https://github.com/Sebmaster/parallel.js/issues/1).

### Code Style

Code style is equivalent to the Visual Studio default code formatting settings, namely:

* Tabs
* when using anonymous functions, put a space between function and the paranthesis ```function () {```
* no spaces around parameters, only after commas
* single quotes for strings
* tests, tests, tests. If you change something and it's testable, there **has** to be a test
